# RAUX Integration with GAIA

This document describes how RAUX (AMD's fork of Open WebUI) integrates with [GAIA](https://github.com/amd/gaia), including the build process, installation options, and how the components fit together.

## Architecture Overview

RAUX is an Electron-based desktop application that can be installed in two primary ways:

1. **Standalone Installation**: Using the RAUX Electron installer (`raux-setup.exe`)
2. **GAIA Integration**: As part of the [GAIA](https://github.com/amd/gaia) installation process

The diagram below illustrates how these components fit together:

```

## Build Process

The build process for RAUX is managed by GitHub Actions workflows. The key workflow creates both the Electron installer and the wheel context for GAIA integration.

### Key Build Artifacts:

1. **Python Wheel Package (.whl)**:
   - Contains the backend Python code
   - Includes the built frontend static files
   - Packaged with environment configuration files

2. **Wheel Context (raux-wheel-context.zip)**:
   - Contains the Python wheel
   - Includes `raux.env` (for Lemonade integration)
   - Used by the Electron installer for Python environment setup

3. **Electron Installer (raux-setup.exe)**:
   - Built using Electron Forge with Squirrel
   - Self-contained Windows installer
   - Handles installation, updates, and uninstallation
   - Auto-launches RAUX after installation (unless prevented)

## Installation Architecture

### Installer Types

RAUX uses different installer technologies for different purposes:

- **RAUX Installer**: Uses **Squirrel** (Electron Forge's auto-updater/installer)
  - Modern, lightweight installer for Electron apps
  - Supports auto-updates and seamless installation
  - Auto-launches the application after installation by default

- **GAIA Installer**: Uses **NSIS** (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System)
  - Traditional Windows installer system
  - More control over installation process
  - Downloads and invokes the RAUX Squirrel installer

### Installation Options

#### 1. Standalone RAUX Installation

When users run `raux-setup.exe` directly:

1. **Squirrel Installer Execution**:
   - Handles Windows installation events
   - Creates desktop shortcuts
   - Installs to user's local app data

2. **First Launch Setup**:
   - Detects missing Python environment
   - Downloads `raux-wheel-context.zip` from GitHub
   - Extracts and installs Python environment
   - Installs RAUX wheel package

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Uses single `raux.env` configuration for Lemonade integration

4. **Auto-Launch**:
   - Application automatically starts after installation
   - Shows progress during Python setup
   - Opens browser when backend is ready

#### 2. GAIA Integration

When RAUX is installed as part of GAIA:

1. **GAIA Installer Process**:
   - GAIA NSIS installer runs its installation
   - Downloads `raux-setup.exe` from GitHub releases
   - Creates auto-launch prevention flag
   - Executes RAUX installer

2. **Auto-Launch Prevention**:
   - GAIA creates `RAUX_PREVENT_AUTOLAUNCH` flag file
   - RAUX installer detects flag and skips auto-launch
   - Shows success message and exits cleanly
   - User can launch RAUX later from desktop shortcut

3. **Integration Benefits**:
   - Seamless installation experience
   - No duplicate RAUX windows during GAIA install
   - Automatic hybrid mode configuration
   - Integrated with GAIA's Lemonade server

## Environment Configuration

RAUX uses a single configuration approach:

### Configuration

**Configuration File**:
- Uses `raux.env` configuration file
- Connects to Lemonade API at `http://localhost:8000/api/v0`
- Integrates with GAIA's AI infrastructure

## Technical Implementation Details

### Auto-Launch Prevention Mechanism

The auto-launch prevention ensures RAUX doesn't automatically start when installed via GAIA:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant GAIA as GAIA Installer
    participant FS as File System
    participant RAUX as RAUX Installer
    participant APP as RAUX App

    GAIA->>FS: Create RAUX_PREVENT_AUTOLAUNCH flag
    GAIA->>RAUX: Execute raux-setup.exe
    RAUX->>RAUX: Squirrel installation
    RAUX->>APP: Attempt to launch
    APP->>FS: Check for prevention flag
    FS-->>APP: Flag exists
    APP->>FS: Remove flag
    APP->>APP: Show success & exit
    Note over APP: No auto-launch occurs
```

### Installation Flow Components

1. **Squirrel Events Handler** (`squirrelEvents.ts`):
   - Handles `--squirrel-install`, `--squirrel-updated`, `--squirrel-uninstall`
   - Creates/removes shortcuts
   - Patches Python configuration

2. **RAUX Setup** (`rauxSetup.ts`):
   - Downloads wheel context from GitHub
   - Extracts Python environment
   - Installs RAUX wheel via pip
   - Configures environment files

3. **Main Process** (`index.ts`):
   - Checks for auto-launch prevention
   - Verifies installation status
   - Manages backend process lifecycle
   - Handles IPC communication

4. **Python Execution** (`pythonExec.ts`):
   - Manages Python subprocess
   - Configures Python paths
   - Handles process communication

## Versioning Scheme

RAUX uses a dual-versioning scheme:

- **Product Version**: Full semantic version (e.g., `0.6.5+raux.0.2.0`)
  - First part (`0.6.5`): Original Open-WebUI version
  - Second part (`raux.0.2.0`): RAUX-specific changes

- **Electron Version**: Numeric only (e.g., `0.2.0`)
  - Required for Windows/Electron compatibility
  - Derived from RAUX portion of product version
  - Used in `raux-electron/package.json`

## File Structure

Key files in the Electron implementation:

```
raux-electron/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts              # Main process entry point
│   ├── rauxSetup.ts          # Installation orchestration

├── forge.config.ts           # Electron Forge configuration
└── package.json              # Electron app configuration
```

## Conclusion

The new Electron-based RAUX installer provides a modern, seamless installation experience that works both as a standalone application and as part of the GAIA ecosystem. The Squirrel installer handles Windows integration efficiently, while the intelligent environment detection ensures RAUX configures itself appropriately for its runtime context.

The auto-launch prevention mechanism enables smooth integration with GAIA's NSIS installer, preventing duplicate windows during installation while maintaining the convenient auto-launch behavior for standalone installations.
